title: Welcome to Lumen's Note
---

This small space serves as the primary platform for sharing my public notes. In the past, I've experimented with different setupsâ€”first with my WordPress blog (now private), then my [xlog blog](https://xlog.lumeny.io/), and later my [personal website built with Hexo](https://www.lumeny.io/). However, each of these fell short of meeting my expectations in one way or another. Now, I'm pleased to have found Quartz, which satisfies nearly all my criteria for an ideal tool - a simple editing process and has the added benefit of helping me gradually develop a well-interconnected knowledge base.
