title: Welcome to Lumen's Note
---

Hi, I'm Lumen. I'm a Robotic Software Engineering right now working at Agile Robots.

## Why this site exists?

This small space serves as the primary platform for sharing my public notes. In the past, I've experimented with different setupsâ€”first with my WordPress blog (now private), then my [xlog blog](https://xlog.lumeny.io/), and later my [personal website built with Hexo](https://www.lumeny.io/). However, each of these fell short of meeting my expectations in one way or another. Now, I'm pleased to have found Quartz, which satisfies nearly all my criteria for an ideal tool - a simple editing process and has the added benefit of helping me gradually develop a well-interconnected knowledge base.

Whether it's short notes or long-form writing, I firmly believe that creating output is the first step in ensuring I've truly learned something. Inspired by [Ellie Huxtable](https://ellie.wtf/), I've adopted a structure that organizes my posts into four categories: 

1) **Posts** for long-form essays and in-depth writing,  
2) **Projects** for anything related to ongoing or completed work,  
3) **Life** for personal reflections and experiences,  
4) **Notes** for shorter, more frequent updates capturing my daily explorations and discoveries.

This content structure encompasses everything I might want to share without restricting me to only polished or meticulously crafted pieces. In fact, the pursuit of perfection can often drain the joy out of blogging, and I shall definitely avoid this trap.
